# Morse-Code-encoder-Decoder-using-Verilog-and-CPLD
This project implements a dual-mode Morse Code Encoder-Decoder system using a CPLD board. The encoder sequentially displays Morse code for decimal digits (0-9) using a finite state machine (FSM), while the decoder translates Morse code inputs into corresponding alphabets on a 7-segment display. The system effectively demonstrates the use of D flip-flops, combinational logic, and 7-segment interfacing in digital systems, all within limited hardware resources.

## Project Objectives
To design and implement a CPLD-based system that:
- Encodes decimal digits (0â€“9) into Morse code using a state machine.
- Decodes user-input Morse code into the alphabet on a 7-segment display.

## Apparatus
- CPLD Board
- Bread Board
- 7-segment display
- Jumper Cables
- Quartus || 64 bit software 

## Morse Code
